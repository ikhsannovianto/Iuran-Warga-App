# Iuran Warga App

**Iuran Warga App** is a web application built with **Laravel** to manage community contributions (iuran warga) for local administrative purposes. The system features two types of users: **Admin** and **Regular User**. Admins have full control over the application, including managing user accounts and overseeing contributions, while regular users can view and update their own contribution records.

The app utilizes **MySQL** (via **XAMPP**) for data storage and supports **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. Additionally, it enables **Excel** and **PDF exports** for generating contribution reports.
